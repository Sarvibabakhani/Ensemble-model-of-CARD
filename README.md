# Ensemble-model-of-CARD
Enhancing the accuracy of X-ray image classification is an essential factor to prompt treatment. this is the
main purpose that We study three conventional neural networks,
DenseNet, CovidNet, and Attention ResNet to investigate their
performances in classifying the chest X-ray images into three
classes, Normal, CovidË™19, and pneumonia. Finally, we use
weighted ensemble model to have all the advantages of these
three networks together . The result of this study was classifying
the images with an accuracy of 95.85%.
